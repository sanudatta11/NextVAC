For Saving Docker containers as new images
docker commit 5d29c3d1d987 ubuntumine1


You will need to save the docker image as a tar file:

docker save -o <save image to path> <image name>
Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp or scp. After that you will have to load the image into docker:

docker load -i <path to image tar file>
PS: You may need to sudo all commands.
