For Saving Docker containers as new images
docker commit 5d29c3d1d987 ubuntumine1


You will need to save the docker image as a tar file:

docker save -o <save image to path> <image name>
Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp or scp. After that you will have to load the image into docker:

docker load -i <path to image tar file>
PS: You may need to sudo all commands.

Remove untagged images Docker :<none>: images
docker rmi $(docker images | grep "^<none>" | awk "{print $3}")

Saving inp and output with all pids and done:
timeout --signal=SIGKILL 4 docker run --rm -P --pids-limit 40 --cpu-quota=60000 --name testname -v /media/stuxnet/med/docker/:/try testdock g++ -o tboj testinp.cpp && timeout 4 ./tboj < inp.txt > out.txt
